# Accounting

Mathematica package for personal accounting. It provides an simple scripting interface for keeping a daily ledger, and can generate financial statement (income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, etc.) using the data from the ledger.

## Getting Started

Ledger.m is the driver script.

To run this script in Mathematica, in the front end, type

```
SetDirectory["/path/to/source/code"]
<< Ledger.m
```

It will load in the package: Accounting.m

A data file for the balance sheet will be generated as "BalanceSheetyymm.mx" for computing the comparative balance sheet next month.

### Installing

Simply put all .m files into a directory.
